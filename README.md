# Learning C++ - A Personal Journey

## Why?
I've always wanted to learn how to code in C++ "correctly". In my Univesity most courses where taught either using Java or in what I can only describe as "FrankenC++", using the `iostream` C++'s library for I/O but everything else using classic C libraries (`cstdio`, `cstdlib`, etc). 

So, combining my interest in Game Development, my utter distaste for FrankenC++, the fact that I hate Java (I'm a C# boy) and my recent experiences with coding interview's cloud based tools, I decided this was a perfect time to learn C++. So I'm using this repository to store my C++ code journey and maybe learn a couple things about myself along the way.

As of february 2021, I've bought a copy of Bjarne Stroustrup's _Programming: Principles and Practices using C++_ as a startup point. Apart from that, I'm using Robert Sedgewick's _Algorithms in C++_ series to learn Algorithms and Data Structures, and finally I'm doing excercises from both [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Goals

As of february 2021, my only goal is to become proficient using C++'s core features and techniques, such as RAII, STL, etc. Maybe later I will tackle something more specific, like Boost, Qt, Vulkan, Networking...
